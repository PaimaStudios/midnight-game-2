# Achievements

## Data Requirements

Achievements rely on player statistics tracked by the node. Below are the **data sources** used for detection.

### From Ledger Payload (no changes needed)
- `player_boss_progress[biome][difficulty]` — boss completion per biome/tier
- `player_abilities[ability_id]` — current spirit inventory with counts
- `all_abilities[ability_id]` — ability definitions (effect type, upgrade level, energy color, AOE flag)
- `gold` — current gold balance
- `BattleState.round` — round counter during active battle
- `BattleState.damage_to_player` — cumulative damage taken in active battle
- `BattleState.damage_to_enemy_0/1/2` — cumulative damage dealt per enemy
- `BattleConfig.loadout` — 7 ability Field IDs used in the battle
- `quests` — active quest entries per player

### Node DB Counters (tracked via payload diffs, no ledger changes)
| Field | Type | Updated When |
|---|---|---|
| `battles_won` | `integer` | Battle disappears from `map[1]` with enemies defeated |
| `battles_lost` | `integer` | Battle disappears with player HP depleted |
| `battles_retreated` | `integer` | Battle disappears with 0 enemy damage (retreat heuristic) |
| `quests_completed` | `integer` | New `true` entry appears in `map[6]` (boss_progress) |
| `quests_failed` | `integer` | Boss battle lost (diff: battle disappears, player HP 0) |
| `total_gold_earned` | `integer` | `map[4]` gold increases between snapshots |
| `total_gold_spent` | `integer` | `map[4]` gold decreases between snapshots |
| `enemies_defeated` | `integer` | Count enemies killed per resolved battle (damage vs HP) |
| `abilities_sold` | `integer` | Ability quantity decreases coinciding with gold increase |
| `abilities_upgraded` | `integer` | Ability `upgrade_level` increases in `map[0]` |
| `total_damage_dealt` | `integer` | Sum `damage_to_enemy_0/1/2` from resolved battles |
| `rounds_played` | `integer` | Sum `BattleState.round` from resolved battles |
| `bosses_defeated` | `integer` | Boss battle won (diff: boss fight disappears, enemies defeated) |

### Per-Battle Tracking (derived from BattleState at battle end)
These can be derived at battle end from existing `BattleState`:
- Rounds survived = `BattleState.round`
- Damage taken = `BattleState.damage_to_player`
- Whether it was a 3-enemy fight = check `BattleConfig` enemy count

## Ledger Payload Map Reference

The ledger snapshot payload contains these maps (indices verified in `game-db.ts`):

| Index | Ledger Variable | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `map[0]` | `all_abilities` | `Map<Field, Ability>` | Ability definitions. `Ability { effect: Maybe<Effect>, on_energy: Vector<3, Maybe<Effect>>, generate_color: Maybe<Uint<0..5>>, upgrade_level: Uint<0..5> }`. `Effect { effect_type: EFFECT_TYPE, amount: Uint<32>, is_aoe: Boolean }`. `EFFECT_TYPE` enum: `attack_phys=0, attack_fire=1, attack_ice=2, block=3`. |
| `map[1]` | `active_battle_states` | `Map<Field, BattleState>` | Packed LE struct. Fields (each `Uint<32>`, 32 bits): `[0] round`, `[1-3] deck_indices`, `[4] damage_to_player`, `[5] damage_to_enemy_0`, `[6] damage_to_enemy_1`, `[7] damage_to_enemy_2`, `[8-10] enemy_move_index_0/1/2`. |
| `map[2]` | `active_battle_configs` | `Map<Field, BattleConfig>` | Packed LE struct. Leading fields: `[0] biome (Uint<32>)`, `[1] difficulty (Uint<32>)`, then `enemies: EnemiesConfig` (3x `EnemyStats`, large), `player_pub_key: Field`, `loadout: Vector<7, Field>`. |
| `map[3]` | `quests` | `Map<Field, QuestConfig>` | Packed LE struct. `[0] biome`, `[1] difficulty`, then `player_pub_key: Field`, `loadout: Vector<7, Field>`, `start_time: Uint<64>`. |
| `map[4]` | `players` | `Map<Field, Player>` | Packed LE struct. `[0] gold (Uint<32>)`, `[1..] rng (Bytes<32>)`. |
| `map[5]` | `player_abilities` | `Map<Field, Map<Field, Uint<32>>>` | Nested map: `player_id → ability_id → quantity`. |
| `map[6]` | `player_boss_progress` | `Map<Field, Map<biome, Map<diff, bool>>>` | Nested map: `player_id → biome → difficulty → completed`. Biome IDs: grasslands=0, desert=1, tundra=2, cave=3. Difficulty: 1, 2, 3. |
| `map[7]` | `levels` | `Map<Level, Map<Uint<64>, EnemiesConfig>>` | Random encounter configs per level. |
| `map[8]` | `bosses` | `Map<Level, EnemiesConfig>` | Boss configs per level. |
| `map[9]` | `quest_durations` | `Map<Level, Uint<64>>` | Quest duration in seconds per level. |
| `map[10]` | `delegations` | `Map<Field, Field>` | Game address → wallet address. |

### Detection Methods

Achievements are detected through three methods:

- **Snapshot** — read directly from the current ledger payload.
- **Diff** — compare consecutive snapshots to detect state transitions (e.g., a battle disappearing from `map[1]` means it resolved). When a battle disappears, capture its last-known `BattleState` and `BattleConfig` from the previous snapshot to evaluate battle-end conditions. Similarly, when a quest disappears from `map[3]`, it was finalized.
- **DB Counter** — counters accumulated in the node database by tracking diffs over time. No on-chain ledger changes needed — the node observes payload transitions and increments counters in `d2d_player_stats`.
