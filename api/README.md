# Midnight Contract API

This package contains an API that will connect with the Midnight network with one endpoint per exported circuit.

`DeployedGame2API` is the main APi that the game frontend will use to interact with the contract, which is implemented via this package's `Game2API`.

Any time this is modified, or if the game contract has been modified, you should re-run `npm run build` here.
